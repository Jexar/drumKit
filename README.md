# Drum Kit JavaScript Project

This is a simple JavaScript project that allows users to play sounds on the drums by clicking or pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard.

## How to Use

The drum kit consists of seven different drum sounds, each assigned to a specific key on the keyboard. To play a sound, simply click on the corresponding drum image or press the key on your keyboard.

The following table shows the keys and corresponding sounds:

| Key | Sound      |

| 2   | medium-tom |
| 3   | small-tom  |
| 4   | crash      |
